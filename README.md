# RecycleChain

## Project Description

RecycleChain is a revolutionary blockchain-based platform that incentivizes recycling activities through smart contracts and token rewards. By leveraging the transparency and immutability of blockchain technology, RecycleChain creates a trustworthy ecosystem where individuals and organizations can track, verify, and reward recycling efforts in real-time.

The platform connects recyclers, verification authorities, and environmental organizations in a decentralized network that promotes sustainable waste management practices through economic incentives.

## Project Vision
